* How to configure a router to prevent attacks

## WiFi Network Discovery

![](images/snooping.jpg)

Step one is finding the WiFi access points around us. We're using a pretty basic Panda PAU05 USB WiFi dongle. The antenna is built in and not very large, so our range isn't spectacular, but it's an effective short range dongle that doesn't draw attention to itself.

If you want to go shopping for an upgrade to your WiFi adapter, I'd recommend having a look a Alfa Networks line up. There are loads of reviews of Kali Linux WiFi adapter reviews like [this one](https://www.wifigeeks.org/best-usb-wifi-adapter-for-kali-linux/), or [this one](http://hackersgrid.com/2018/06/top-kali-wifi-adapters.html). I can personally vouch for the [Panda PAU05](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Panda-300Mbps-Wireless-N-USB-Adapter-w-WPS-button-802-11-n-2-4GHz/122010950775) (lucky you!), [TP-Link TL-WN722N]() (Version 1 only), and the [Alfa AWUS036ACH](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Wireless-External/dp/B00VEEBOPG) (driver setup and compatibility with aircrack suite is tricky).

### Aircrack Suite

The [aircrack-ng suite](https://aircrack-ng.org/) is, in their words:
>
>a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.
>
>It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:
>
>* Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools
>* Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection
>* Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection)
>* Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)
>
>All tools are command line which allows for heavy scripting.

One of the reasons we're using Kali rather than trying to turn our OSX machines into hacking beasts is that not all of the aircrack-ng tools are available for OSX, at least not without a lot of extra work compiling binaries from the source. If you want to take that on, checkout their [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng).

Some of the tools that we'll be covering today include:

* **airmon-ng** - safely and quickly change WiFi adapters between monitor and managed modes
* **airodump-ng** - a utility to sniff WiFi packets for access points and wifi devices
* **aireplay-ng** - a tool that can perform various packet injection attacks that aid in WEP and WPA cracking
* **aicrack-ng** - an offline WEP and WPA brute force password cracking tool

### Monitor Mode with `airmon-ng`

Let's say we want to test our home network setup for any vulnerabilities. The first step would be to figure out if your network is visible to an attacker, and what they might be able to find out about who is connected to your network.

1. Fire up Kali if you haven't already.
2. Open the Terminal app.
3. Run the command, `ifconfig` and you should see something like this:

![](images/ifconfig.png)

`wlan0` is your WiFi adapter. In Linux land the entries here are called devices. `lo` is your local host device. It's a virtual network device that lets applications send data to each other using network protocols. It's good for testing, but let's focus on `wlan0`.

If we want to "sniff" the airwaves for WiFi data packets, we need to put our adapter in monitor mode. There are a couple of ways to do this. We'll use `airmon-ng` because it's simple, quick, and safe.

1. Run `airmon-ng start wlan0`
2. Run `ifconfig` again and check out the results.
3. You should have a new device, `wlan0mon`, and `wlan0` if nowhere to be found.

### On the Airwaves

![](images/wifisafari.jpg)

Before we zero in on access points (APs), I was to step back and give you the full overview of what's flying through the airwaves. With your WiFi adapter in monitor mode, you're basically intercepting signals broadcast openly into the ether. These include things like beacons, packets that APs and devices send out to advertise their presence and to solicit a response from a previously visited AP.

When your WiFi router is just sitting there idle, it's actually broadcasting packets periodically to let devices within range know that it's there. Even if your network is "invisible" it's still broadcasting, it's just zeroed out its name. These broadcast beacons can be collected in a process known as "war driving", in order to geolocate access points. It's known that [Google Street View has been collecting this data, and more](https://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/google-street-view-pursued-wardriving-by-design/d/d-id/1104110).

When your device is dissociated from a network, if WiFi is still enabled, it's sending out solicitation packets, asking if any networks it's previously connected to are in the area. This can (has been and likely is) used to track people. The creative studio (and friends of mine), Branger_Briz, made [WiFi Data Safari](https://brangerbriz.com/portfolio/wifi-data-safari) and [Probe Kit](http://probekit.brangerbriz.com/) to illustrate just how much data we leak into the world by leaving our WiFi enabled when in transit.

### Wireshark

![](images/shark.jpg)

To see the raw packets, we need have a few different options. In both Linux and Unix (OSX) `tcpdump` can be used to capture, display, and filter WiFi packets from the command line. Typically, `tcpdump` is used in conjunction with scripts or in the background to support other applications that are able to filter and sort through the vast amount of data that can be captured in particularly active locations.

Let's have a look at Wireshark, a powerful GUI tool that gives us the ability to sort, filter, and inspect packets comprehensively.

1. From the Terminal, run `wireshark`
2. When the application loads, look for the **Capture** section and select **wlan0mon**
3. Click the blue shark fin button in the upper left of the window

![](images/thematrix.gif)

Every entry is a packet. Some are broadcast advertisements and solicitations, others are encryption handshakes, some contain data payloads. There's all sorts of stuff we can capture and Wireshark gives us the ability to reconstruct packet sequences to view data exchanged between devices as well as filter the packets to show only specific types between specific devices.

OK... We'll come back to Wireshark in a bit. Let's move on to our first attack.

## WiFi Attacks

### WPS Attacks

![](images/wps.png)

If I were an attacker, I'd go for the low hanging fruit, vulnerabilities that make attacks quick and easy to pull off. You might already know about WPS, or at the very least might recognize the logo from a button on your router.

WPS stands for WiFi Protected Setup. It was a protocol established for WiFi Protected Access (WPA) that enabled easy connection to a network based on an 8 digital pin. Supplying the correct PIN would allow access to the network. However, unless there are security measures in place, brute forcing the PIN is a trivial matter due to how the PIN is generated and how the protocol responds to a partially correct PIN. Full details can be found [here](goodies/viehboeck_wps.pdf).

The US Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) issued [a bulletin](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA12-006A) regarding WPS in 2012. If device manufacturers had immediately begun implementing secure default settings disabling WPS by default, the number of devices still vulnerable to this kind of attack would be a lot less. Today, most devices ship with WPS disabled, and those that don't employ some form of rate limiting.

#### Safety First...

I shouldn't have to tell you at this point, but you shouldn't perform the following attacks on networks  you don't own or don't have permission to test.

That said, if you're going to go rogue, do so at your own peril, but please take some precautions to protect yourself and maintain anonymity:

1. Use a live system and make sure any persistent data is securely encrypted with a strong key.
2. Change your MAC address using `macchanger -r wlan0mon`.
3. Think before you press enter.

Using the following techniques, you can test whether your devices is vulnerable. If yours is and you can't disable WPS, then it's time to consider upgrading to a new router.

#### Brute Force

![](images/bruteforce.gif)

This method is likely not going to work. But if it does, then you should probably fix that. The tools we need to pull this off are:

* `airmon-ng`
* `wash`
* `reaver`

1. If your WiFi device isn't already in **monitor mode**, run `airmon-ng start wlan0`
2. Next run `wash -i wlan0mon` and let it run for a minute or so
3. You should see the access point you want to test. Make note of it's **BSSID** and **channel**.
4. To start the brute force attack, run `reaver -vv -N -i wlan0mon -b 01:23:45:67:89:0F -c 11` and change the **BSSID** after `-b` and the **channel** after `-c` to suit your needs.

`reaver` randomly guesses the pin and keeps track of its progress, creating a unique session for each BSSID you attempt to crack. Chances are, you'll get in 3, maybe 5 guesses before `reaver` tells you that it detects rate limiting and will try again in 60 seconds. If you're patient and have no where to go for a few days, you can keep this up. Eventually you'll get through. Otherwise, you can setup a Raspberry Pi to run this attack while you go on with your life.

#### Pixie Dust

![](images/pixiedust.png)

Some chipsets are vulnerable to the Pixie Dust attack, which makes cracking the WPS pin a breeze. Provided you're close enough to the AP, within a few minutes, you should be able to crack the network keys.

1. Do steps 1-3 of the brute force instructions above.
2. Run `reaver -vv -N -i wlan0mon -b 01:23:45:67:89:0F -c 11 - Z`
3. If you're lucky, it'll find the PIN on the first try. Sometimes you have to try multiple times before you get a a good sense of whether your target is vulnerable.
4. If you do find the PIN, run `reaver -vv -N -i wlan0mon -b 01:23:45:67:89:0F -c 11 -p 12345678` and replace the number after `-p` with the PIN you found.
5. That should give you the WPA keys.

From my experience, certain chipsets and versions are more vulnerable than others. Here's a quick assessment of what I've encountered:

| Chipset | Version | Vulnerable?	|
|---		|---		|---			|
|Realtek	|			|Yes			|
|Broadcom	|			|No				|
|Atheros	|			|Sometimes	|
|Ralink	|			|Sometimes	|
