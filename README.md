# Ethical Hacking

## Classes by Phillip David Stearns

This collection of classes was developed for internet users who have little to no technical background, but are curious to know more about how the interconnected world around them is put together.

We do this by breaking things and taking things apart in order to build an understanding of how they were made. The spirit of hacking is used as a framework for understanding how to navigate safely through the internet as it becomes a place increasingly weaponized by criminal groups and state sponsored threat actors.

Currently being taught at [Pioneer Works](https://pioneerworks.org/classes)

## Modules

The Class is a work in progress with the idea that students can advance through topics in tracked threads, advancing through different levels of skill. 

Courses are not totally modular and do not necessarily build off one another across topics. However, for each topic and each skill level within each topic, there may be a choice of different modules available. Each module will create a path towards another.
